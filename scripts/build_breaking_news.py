"""Generate www.manzill.com/breaking — a live, AI-authored, single-story breaking-news page
focused on ONE beat: government/police bribery and policy incompetence in Rajasthan (Jaipur-first).

Pipeline: fetch Google News RSS (bribery/ACB/policy-failure queries) -> drop digest/roundup items
-> cluster and keep Rajasthan stories -> pick a single fresh policy/bribery lead (Jaipur-first) ->
search the web for RELATED coverage of that one story and fold it in (enrich_lead) -> archive every
story's multi-day arc (rolling 30 days) -> ask Groq (OpenAI-compatible) for a Hindi write-up with a
rich, timestamped, sourced timeline -> render breaking/index.html (+ RSS + news sitemap) and persist
breaking/data/{state,archive}.json. On a day with no fresh policy story the last policy page is kept.

Runs from GitHub Actions on a ~20 min cron. No server, no secrets in the page:
the Groq key is read from the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable only.

Usage:
    python scripts/build_breaking_news.py            # full run (needs GROQ_API_KEY)
    python scripts/build_breaking_news.py --no-ai    # render from feeds only
